##Crime, Weather & Unemployment Analysis

In the 'crime_project_merge.py' script, we merged the data from
'weather', 'crime from 2001' and 'unemployment' datafiles. This enables the
integration of the groupby() function, which we can use to compare columns and
explore the data.

The Charts

Using the 'graph.py' script, a handful of important observations come to surface.
First, we can discern the most frequent crime types in Chicago from 2001-2020, with
Theft, Battery and Criminal Damage retaining the top spots, followed by Assault, Other
and Deceptive Practice close behind. Next, we can discern the highest occurances of crime
by location type, showing that crimes most frequently occur on the street (29.6%),
residence (21.5%) and apartment (16.7%) followed by sidewalk, other and parking garage.

The next graph shows a periodic trend in the Number of Crimes per year from 2001-
2020. This illustrates 'periodic' pattern in crimes, while an initial observation may
surmise that crimes tend to surge and peak in the early period of the year, precipitously
drop in the latter months and quickly increase following the beginning of the year.
The graph also shows an overall decreasing trend for crime from 2001-2016, after
which the peaks and low points remain relatively constant from 2016-2019, followed
by a steep drop afterwards. Referring to the next graph, 'Rolling Sum of Crimes from
'2001-2020', this graph provides a visual of each day as a representation of the sum
of crimes from the previous year. While the previous graph demonstrated a decreasing trend,
this visual provides a clear enough perspective of the trend to make a judgement call
(if no other data was on hand). If the trend is deceasing, then we can state with a considerable
measure of certainty that the overall crime rate had been decreasing for that year (likewise,
if the sum is constant, then the crime rate largely remained unchanged). Despite
a slight down tick in the later portion of 2020, the crime rate appears to be consistent
from 2019-2020.

For a more granular perspective, we can access graphs for individual crime types
to gain a better understanding of how individual crime types are trending. The graph
shows that the majority of crime types are trending downward (which may help explain
the slight decrease in crime right exhibited in the rolling crimes graph). However,
the surge of weapons violations, other narcotics violations, concealed carry and
interference with a public officer may have mitigated the rolling sum downward trend.

The Data

The 'crime_project_merge.py' script contains two powerful groupby() function results
that provide a framework to observe Chicago unemployment, crime and weather. The
first file, 'unenmprate.csv', incorporates the following keys 'Year', 'unemployment rate'
'year' and 'count.' External research offers a key stat-the long term average Unemployment
rate in Chicago is 7.61% (unemp rate hovered at this level from 2003-2005, surged to a high of 12%
in 2010 and trended downard but remained at or above the longterm rate until declining
steadily from 2015-2020. From an oberver's persective, the data from the spreadsheet
shows that the highest crime counts are concentrated in the period listed above-2002, 2006
and 2012 are years that appear in a filter for highest crime counts by type. The type highest
crime type counts are 688289 (Theft) and 659057 (Battery), both of which occured in 2002, during
a time of 6.6% unemployment. The third highest crime count, 528234 for the crime type Theft occured in
2012 under an unemployment rate of 9%. Certain spikes in unemployment hold a certain amount of explanatory
power (acknowledging the variety of omitted variables that have an affect on unemployment rate)-for example,
the total count for Theft almost doubled from 2001-2002, with an unemployment rate that surged from
5.1% to 6.6%, with a 2002 Theft crime count of 688,289. While higher unemployment does not necessarily necessitate
the highest crime count (Theft in 2010 @ 11.3% unemployment hovered around 153512), it is still a powerful explanatory
variable in assessing crime rate trends.

The merge script contains a groupby() command for 'Primary Type', 'Mean Temperature', 'Max Temperature' and indexed
by 'counts.' It is important to keep in mind that these counts are groupe by 'Month', while the unemployment rate groupby()
used 'Year', so counts will be much smaller.

Excel Filtering by Crime counts, the highest crime count, 99,265 for Theft in 2001 does not correspond to the highest average
Max temperature, but falls closely within the top ten count for yearly Max Temperatures in the dataset. With a year average max temperature of
64.6 degrees F, there is a strong relationship beetween the highest crime counts and the years that exhibit the highest year Max Temperature,as the crime counts in the
highest ten all occur during years with max temperatures of 58 degrees and above.

Sorting by Mean temperatureF, the first observation made is on the effect of the minimum mean tempearture and crime count. The lowest mean temperatureF
registers at 23.16 degrees and corresponds to a Theft Crime count of 61,565 (2014). The crime counts for narcotics during 2014 (again, the year with the
lowest  average temperature for the year) holds an even greater impact on robbery crime counts (9799), criminal tresspassing (7539) and homicide (426). While
this may have been an anomoly, an obsevation regarding the next coldest mean temperature, 48.96 degrees, exhibits a Theft crime count of 999875, followed by Battery (88379)
and Criminal Damage (55011). As the average temperature increases, the magnitude of the highest frequency crime types increases in a positive manner, although this is not always the case, as
obseved from Theft crime type count in 2010 with an average temperature of 54 degrees registering at 76,759 (although the max temperature registers at 62.89 degrees, so we can assume
a warmer year overall).

While a significant portion of the data aligns follows an increase in crime type as the mean temperature increases, a wide variety of variables exist by year, county, police department etc.that
necessitate the implementation of fixed effects and an acknowledgment of ommitted variable bias. In summation, this data set would benefit from a regression analysis with fixed effects and the
inclusion of additional ommitted variables; however, based on the magnitude of the data presented, we are able to make initial observations on fundamental relationships between crime and unemployment
and weather and crime.
